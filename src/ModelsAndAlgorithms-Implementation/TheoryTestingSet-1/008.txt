The features of Procedural programming paradigm: These are Local variable global variable, predefined function modularity and parametar passing 
Local variable; It is declared under main function and it works in a specific functions
where it was define


Global variable: It is declared outside the other function and it can works in whole function.
Parametar Passing it pass parameter to
function.
Modularity. It's the
way
to combine two
different function to solve a
large task
Predefined function: It's a
set of instruction
that's
name are
defined
