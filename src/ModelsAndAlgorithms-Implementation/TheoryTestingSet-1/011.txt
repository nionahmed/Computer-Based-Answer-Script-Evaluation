Procedural Programming Paradigm is a style or method of programming where we can solve a problem by dividing them into many procedures.
The feature or key characteristics of Procedural programming paradigm!
Predefined Punction: In a program we have to use many functions to solve a problem. some built in functions by But then solve a problem in less time.
These are predefined function. As an example "Chare At()' is a predefined function. We can search for an amount in a Junction
Local variable: "Local variables are built and defined in the scope.Their values can't be modified outside of
a program. And
the scope change in the outside of the scope
will not effect the local variables.


Global Variable: Global variables are "declared and defined outside
of scopeAnd they canbe used by the on the whole program without coping; These types of variable are modified outside of the scope.


modularity in to In a program we
-can divide a code ind into different  module to
solve faster and effectivly.
So, In procedural paradigm
can divide the whole task in


different procedure which are called module. As Imperative" paradigm has a derived form called
Structureal programming.
On
Modular




programming. As a type of imperative fparcadigm procedived paradigm is also
a
modular,

Parameter Passing:
Parameteres are
the element in the.

"pass by numbers" pass by age,
