Procedural programming is a type of Imperative programming. It has certain features
like-
1. Predefined function
2. Local variables 
3. Global variable
4. Modularity
5. Parameter passing


Predefined functions 
This programming han predefined functions which means names are given to functions and they try to find these function when they try to run the function


Local Variable
Local variables are defined in the local function they can not work outside the they can not be called outside the area


Global variable: Global variables are defined after each function. So they can not be used outside the local area.


Modularity
Modularity means When programs have individual tasks but they joint to finish the larger task
and then continue untill all the tasks are completed.
Parameter Passing:
Parameter passing is done by in dore by parameter passing by name, passing by date, parring by number, parasing by value.
